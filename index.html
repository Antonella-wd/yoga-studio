            <h3>Ashtanga</h3>
            <p>Ashtanga is a very dynamic and athletic form of hatha yoga, made up of six series or levels, with a fixed order of postures. It is rooted in vinyasa, the flowing movements between postures, with a focus on energy and breath. While it is a very physical practice, it also promotes mental clarity and inner peace.</p>

            <h3>Hatha</h3>
            <p>Hatha Yoga (ha=”sun” tha=”moon”) attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), bandha (energy locks or seals) and shatkarma (internal cleansing).</p>

            <h3>Bikram</h3>
            <p>Bikram yoga is a type of hot yoga in which practitioners perform 26 asanas (poses) and two Pranayama breathing exercises in a room heated to at least 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The Bikram method is considered the original hot yoga practice, invented in the 1970s by yoga teacher Bikram Choudhury. </p>
